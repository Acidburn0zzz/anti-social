## TODO

* Allow user to set times when blocking should occur
* Let user choose length of block toggle timeout
* Implement block toggle timeout timeout, user chosen also.
* Per-site blocking times(?)
* Decide on licensing
* Figure out signing / publishing process

## NOTES

* Notifications are ugly on my version of Ubuntu: that is related to this bug:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1383964 and my only fix is to not use notifications. WONTDO: if we're changing the state of the browser behind the users back - and that is intrinsic to auto-timing out a block toggle - we must let the user know we have done so. So ugly notifications for some it is.
* Icons need to be prettier.
