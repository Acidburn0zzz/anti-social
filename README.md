## anti-social

A browser extension aimed at increasing human happiness by blocking social
media sites.

### What does it do?

* You can block specific pages, directories, or whole domains.
* You can control when the blocker operates both with a weekly schedule and with a snooze button.
* The weekly schedule indicates which days anti-social should block sites: eg, only block Monday to Friday.
* On days when blocking is on, you can set an automatic window when blocking is temporarily turned off: eg, don't block at lunchtime.
* If you don't want an automatic window, you can set the length of it to zero, and there won't be one.
* You can turn blocking off with a 'snooze' button in the popup menu, but it comes back on again after five minutes.
* If you use the 'snooze' button, you can't use it again for the next hour.
* You can change these default snooze timeouts; snooze can be up to 30 minutes, snooze timeout up to six hours.
* If you set the snooze timeout to zero, you can snooze as often as you like: use of this option is between you and your conscience.

### Oh, like Impulse Blocker.

Yes, much like [Impulse Blocker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/impulse-blocker/).

### And Block Site.

Yes. A lot like [Block Site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/block-site-2/).

### And that other one you found last week but can't find now

Yes. That was the very phone-homey one. ~~I'll link to it here when I find it again.~~

UPDATE: Found it, it is/was (confusingly) also called 'BlockSite' (no space) and is/was not just phone-homey but also generally annoying in other ways to the extent of being widely regarded as malware. It has now been withdrawn from the Firefox extension repository, from the Chrome Store and from Google Play. Not linking to it.

anti-social will *never* phone home or collect any data from users in any way.

### And LeechBlock

Yes. A great deal like [LeechBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/).

LeechBlock is mature and very full-featured. I would go so far as to say that had I found LeechBlock three weeks ago I would never have written anti-social. But I didn't, and here we are.

### And SelfControl

Sort of. Not really. [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) does the same sort of thing but at the network level. Plus it's Mac only. anti-social is a Firefox extension; it doesn't mess with your hosts file and it's not a proxy. (*Translation from Geek: anti-social only works in Firefox - it does not stop you from accessing blocked sites using other programs. SelfControl and the other programs mentioned in this paragraph work on your whole internet connection, and stop you from accessing blocked sites completely.*) If you want something like that there's also [SelfRestraint](https://github.com/ParkerK/selfrestraint/) for Windows and [Chomper](https://github.com/aniketpanjwani/chomper) for Linux. I haven't tried any of them so am slightly hazy on how they actually work.

### This is your first go at a web extension isn't it

Awww. Is it that obvious?

### Yes

Thanks.

### TRANSLATIONS

* Danish translation by Kristian Thy.
* French, German and Spanish translations by myself (and help needed to fix them...)
